# Wind

- It always seems to be a good +5mph _less_ than surline reckons
- Usually from the west, south-west or south during storm conditions
- Offshore days (that still have discernible swell!) only usually happen on the last day or two after storm conditions

# Swell

Almost always some flavour of south-westerly.

# Spots

## Hot pipe
- Beach break
- Wind: South-facing, so usually cross-shore or onshore
- Tide: I prefer low-mid (~2.2m). Mid (+2.7m) usually means you're sufing the inside but this is also what a lot of locals do. Definitely low tides when it's tiny/offshore/long-period
- Over 20mph cross-shore and you're better off going to [New beach](#new-beach)
- Convenient parking right in front
- Can line up a bit, depends on what the sandbars are doing

## New beach
- Beach break
- Wind: South-facing, so usually cross-shore or onshore
- Tide: I prefer low-mid (~2.2m). Mid (+2.7m) usually means you're sufing the inside but this is also what a lot of locals do. Definitely low tides when it's tiny/offshore/long-period
- Generally ~1ft bigger than [Shoreham Beach Green](#shoreham-beach-green) or [Lancing](#lancing)
- The harbour can provide a bit of shelter from westerly winds between up to 30mph
- If wind is <20mph the [hot pipe](#hot-pipe) is ususally prefereable because of parking
- Parking is quite inconvenient as it's a 10min walk from Carats carpark

## Soldiers
- Harbour wall break
- Wind: Ususally protected from the wall – even in 50mph winds!
- Tide: Generally, the lower the tide the better. Low spring tides even better. Even when it's big, getting near mid (2.5m) will be too high
- Shelter from the harbour means it only works in big storm conditions. "+4ft" on Magic Seaweed 
- South-westerly wind is best, west is ok, southerly through to east is unsurfable
- Weird wave. Long, but often just straight down the wall towards the beach. _Sometimes_ it can wall up with decent section further into the harbour
- The wall is sketchy as fuck – not for the faint-hearted
- Convenient parking

## Shoreham Beach Green
- Beach break
- Usually ~1ft smaller than other local spots
- Wind: South-facing, so usually cross-shore or onshore
- Tide: Low-mid (~2.2m) is usually best. Mid (+2.7m) usually means you're sufing the inside. Low tides when it's tiny/offshore/long-period
- Only worth it if conditions are okay and you want to avoid a crowd
- Easy/free parking

## Lancing
- Beach/reef break
- Usually ~1ft smaller than other local spots
- Tide: Low-mid (~2.2m) is usually best. Mid (+2.7m) usually means you're sufing the inside. Low tides when it's tiny/offshore/long-period
- Wind: Beach is slightly south-east facing, so slightly more chance of offshore (compared to other local spots) when it's blowing westerly/north-westerly
- There is a small "reef" made of large pebbles dumped in the sea in front of the bandstand/beach houses – makes for a fun wave ([ref](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1469659/215808430-bfdaadf8-0ec6-469e-a470-866f9981249d.jpeg))
- Convenient parking
