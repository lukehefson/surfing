# Spots

## South Point
- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/BXwhR2rW5zpqAfdr7)
- Depending on the swell size/direction can work from low to high tide
- Reef break
- Entry
  - Both will require a little walk over the shallow reef until it's deep enough to paddle. There are sharp rocks and (mostly non-poisonous) urchins, so place your foot down slowly and carefully to avoid getting spiked
  - See [map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1469659/172950596-65413cf5-981c-45b8-abc7-51bb304a0f09.png)
  1. There is a **_tiny_** bit of beach to the left of the main entrance (looking out to sea)
  2. Or, walk further down the left to the bigger stretch of beach
- Exit:
  1. The tiny beach exit is in front of the middle coconut palm tree **BUT** you should _aim_ for the second house along when paddling/riding in and let the inside current pull you towards the tiny beach until it's too shallow to paddle
  2. The bigger stretch of beach generally seems to be a trickier exit as the white water can be wilder here

## Freights Bay (aka Cotton House Bay)
- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/paPiFN6tgg1L6DZG6)
- Sandy reef break, _almost_ a point break
- Best on a pushing mid tide, still decent on a low tide, high tide only works if swell is decent _or_ you surf the inside in front of the pagoda 
- The better the swell the more you'll want to move towards the point (usually close to the point doesn't have much of a line when it's smaller)

## Brandons (aka Brandens, aka Drill Hall Beach)
- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/SmbYjJoJa9hX4wyU7)
- Depending on the swell size/direction can work from low to high tide
- Can be bigger than other south coast spots on the same easterly/south easterly swell
- Somewhat unfriendly-to-non-locals vibe from locals compared to other south coast spots
- Reef break
- Entry/Exit: Further down the beach towards the Hilton and then a (long-ish) paddle wide up and around to the peak
