# General notes

Just _don't_ put your feet down if you don't have to. Even sandier-bottomed spot like Freights have scorpion fish/lion fish – although you'd have to be very unlucky to step on one – more likey is that you'll scratch your foot on a hidden, sharp piece of coral.  

## Swell

- For the most part, the **south coast** scoops up (and cleans up) the prevailing east/north-east/south-east swells – so has more consistent surf
- The **west coast and north-west** spots _will only work_ if there is a non-trivial northly swell. These are more random than the prevailing easterly swells (apparently if there is a big dump of snow on the north-eastern seaboard of the US, that results in north swell in Barbados)
  - The **north-west** spots (e.g. Maycocks) have a tendency to work more often because their location means they can catch north swells with a bit of east in them
    - The [`Gibbs 1` webcam](https://www.iwcpinc.com/cameras/gibbes-1/) can be used as a proxy to tell if e.g. Maycocks it working on a minimum of (Surfline) 4ft + 12secs. If it's "sucking up" and looks [like this]([url](https://github.com/lukehefson/node-app/assets/1469659/289be21c-e3c0-4f3e-86d7-176b10b0d17d)), that's good. If it's not – it looks [like this](https://github.com/lukehefson/node-app/assets/1469659/8bf25e4a-a0a8-4713-b6d3-4fe16d810c0e). You might have to watch the webcam for 15/20mins though as sets can take that long to reoccur 
  - The **directly west** spots (e.g. Batts Rock) need a straight north swell or north-westly

# Spots

## South Point
- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/BXwhR2rW5zpqAfdr7)
- Depending on the swell size/direction can work from low to high tide
- Reef break
- Mostly lefts
- Entry
  - Both will require a little walk over the shallow reef until it's deep enough to paddle. There are sharp rocks and (mostly non-poisonous) urchins, so place your foot down slowly and carefully to avoid getting spiked
  - See [map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1469659/172950596-65413cf5-981c-45b8-abc7-51bb304a0f09.png)
  1. Use the **_tiny_** bit of beach to the left of the main entrance (looking out to sea) in front of the first house and the second coconut palm along
  2. Or, walk further down the left to the bigger stretch of beach
- Exit:
  1. The tiny beach exit in front of the second coconut palm, **BUT** you should _aim_ for the second house along when paddling/riding in and let the inside current pull you towards the tiny beach until it's too shallow to paddle
  2. The bigger stretch of beach generally seems to be a trickier exit as the white water can be wilder here

## Freights Bay (aka Cotton House Bay)
- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/paPiFN6tgg1L6DZG6)
- Sandy reef break, _almost_ a point break
- Mostly lefts
- Best on a pushing mid tide, still decent on a low tide, high tide only works if swell is decent _or_ you surf the inside in front of the pagoda 
- The better the swell the more you'll want to move towards the point (usually close to the point doesn't have much of a line when it's smaller)

## Brandons (aka Brandens, aka Drill Hall Beach)
- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/SmbYjJoJa9hX4wyU7)
- Depending on the swell size/direction can work from low to high tide
- Can be bigger than other south coast spots on the same easterly/south easterly swell
- Somewhat unfriendly-to-non-locals vibe from locals compared to other south coast spots
- Reef break
- Mostly lefts
- Entry/Exit: Further down the beach towards the Hilton and then a (long-ish) paddle wide up and around to the peak

## Maycocks

- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/7Nfmz88BN7dLE1Vt6)
- Involves walking downhill through a little jungle walk
- Needs a northern swell
- Best at low tide
- Reef break
- Mostly **rights** (somewhat rare for Barbados!)
- Entry/exit: There is a bit of beach with a more gentle slope/less urchins, but aim wide along the deeper water channel going out/coming in to avoid getting caught in the inside (see [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1469659/174449204-9ffff129-b443-43d4-9396-b67db192c116.png))
- When there is only _just_ enough north swell to make it doable, you can sit a little further inside and towards the north end – but you'll need to bail before the shallow reef
- You can tell when a good set/wave is coming in by looking north – as they line up nicely out to sea before they eventually get to the takeoff point. Crappier waves without a good face don’t line up in the same way

## Fryers Well (aka Hull)

- [Google map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7q2ESBn6zzQ1dZjh8)
- Park up at the end of the road and then walk a little way down to the small bit of beach
- Needs a northern swell
- Can't handle a ver big swell (overhead+) as it then starts closing out
- Long lulls between sets. When checking, make sure you wait for a set before writing it off as flat
- Look for the boats pointing northwards– that means there is north swell in the water
- If Maycocks is closing-out – try here
- Best on a pushing mid-tide. Mid-tide on the drop will be more "sucky". Low tide can apparently be faster and barrelling but still managable (depending on the swell size)
- Right-hander!!
- Take off is relatively gentle. Usually needs a little bit of angle to get ahead of the wave (like South Point)
- Walls up and peels very consitently for long rides
- There is a section that looks like it's closing out, but can be made past with a floater/"check turn"/tap
- Entry/Exit: Just straight out from the beach with a little angle towards the peak which is usually in front of the house to the left of the beach (looking back to the beach)

## Pebbles

- Not surfed it yet – just what I've heard:
  - Needs east swell PLUS some form of NW swell. E.g. at least NNW ('North of NW')
 
## Accra

- Not surfed it yet – just what I've heard:
  - Righthander!
    - Take off more in front of the boardwalk and then end up more in front of Accra Beach Hotel
  - Needs similar swell conditions to Freight (east swell), but is less forgiving with the wind direction as it's facing south – so prefers wind that is between ENE, NE or NNE

## Parlour

- [Annotated map](https://github.com/lukehefson/surfing/assets/1469659/7379cc3e-8c6a-40ca-8eab-c02a0bf945f0)
- Intermediates need very low (minus 10mph including gusts), crosshore at least (if not offshore) wind and not too big a swell
- Lower-to-mid tides (when it's not big)
- Park on the main road through Bathsheba near the pink chrurch or the little bridge
- Entry
  - From the beach out to sea: Get in between 'parlour rock' and the smaller boulder to the left of it – **there is a channel here**
  - Paddle out in as shallow water as possible to avoid urchins
  - Go straight out to see through the channel and then paddle left to the breaks once you've made it out back (NOT diagonally)
- Exit
  - Aim to the left (looking back at the beach) of parlour roack and/or the last smaller boulder on the beach in front of the pink church. Or, anywhere on the wider past of the beach. Just NOT back in front of parlour rock or to the right of it (looking back at the beach) where you got in
- Three peaks going left to right when viewed from the beach
  1. Left-most
     - This was described to me as an ‘open water’ wave – so not consistently breaking in one direction (reef or point break), not peaks all over the place (beach break) and not quite an A-frame (consistently breaking left and right). So, you basically judge the direction at the last minute
     - Going right is fatter/softer to get in– but longer and more rewarding
     - Going left is easier to get in/steeper– but shorter/more critical
     - Catching a long right can take you past parlour rock towards 'High Rock' (the next peak along in front of the highest boulder that juts out
  2. Centre
     - A-frame
  3. Right-most
     - Don't really know/didn't go near it as it's right over the far end of the bay in front of Bathsheba park
