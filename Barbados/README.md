# General notes

## Swell

- For the most part, the **south coast** scoops up (and cleans up) the prevailing east/north-east/south-east swells – so has more consistent surf
- The **west coast and north-west** spots _will only work_ if there is a non-trivial northly swell. These are more random than the prevailing easterly swells (apparently if there is a big dump of snow on the north-eastern seaboard of the US, that results in north swell in Barbados)
  - The **north-west** spots (e.g. Maycocks) have a tendency to work more often because their location means they can catch north swells with a bit of east in them
  - The **directly west** spots (e.g. Batts Rock) need a straight north swell or north-westly

# Spots

## South Point
- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/BXwhR2rW5zpqAfdr7)
- Depending on the swell size/direction can work from low to high tide
- Reef break
- Mostly lefts
- Entry
  - Both will require a little walk over the shallow reef until it's deep enough to paddle. There are sharp rocks and (mostly non-poisonous) urchins, so place your foot down slowly and carefully to avoid getting spiked
  - See [map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1469659/172950596-65413cf5-981c-45b8-abc7-51bb304a0f09.png)
  1. Use the **_tiny_** bit of beach to the left of the main entrance (looking out to sea) in front of the first house and the second coconut palm along
  2. Or, walk further down the left to the bigger stretch of beach
- Exit:
  1. The tiny beach exit in front of the second coconut palm, **BUT** you should _aim_ for the second house along when paddling/riding in and let the inside current pull you towards the tiny beach until it's too shallow to paddle
  2. The bigger stretch of beach generally seems to be a trickier exit as the white water can be wilder here

## Freights Bay (aka Cotton House Bay)
- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/paPiFN6tgg1L6DZG6)
- Sandy reef break, _almost_ a point break
- Mostly lefts
- Best on a pushing mid tide, still decent on a low tide, high tide only works if swell is decent _or_ you surf the inside in front of the pagoda 
- The better the swell the more you'll want to move towards the point (usually close to the point doesn't have much of a line when it's smaller)

## Brandons (aka Brandens, aka Drill Hall Beach)
- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/SmbYjJoJa9hX4wyU7)
- Depending on the swell size/direction can work from low to high tide
- Can be bigger than other south coast spots on the same easterly/south easterly swell
- Somewhat unfriendly-to-non-locals vibe from locals compared to other south coast spots
- Reef break
- Mostly lefts
- Entry/Exit: Further down the beach towards the Hilton and then a (long-ish) paddle wide up and around to the peak

## Maycocks

- [Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/7Nfmz88BN7dLE1Vt6)
- Involves walking downhill through a little jungle walk
- Needs a northern swell
- Best at low tide
- Reef break
- Mostly **rights** (somewhat rare for Barbados!)
- Entry/exit: There is a bit of beach with a more gentle slope/less urchins, but aim wide along the deeper water channel going out/coming in to avoid getting caught in the inside (see [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1469659/174449204-9ffff129-b443-43d4-9396-b67db192c116.png))
- When there is only _just_ enough north swell to make it doable, you can sit a little further inside and towards the north end – but you'll need to bail before the shallow reef
- You can tell when a good set/wave is coming in by looking north – as they line up nicely out to sea before they eventually get to the takeoff point. Crappier waves without a good face don’t line up in the same way
